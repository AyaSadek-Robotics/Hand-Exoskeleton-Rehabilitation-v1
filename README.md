# Development-of-Hand-Exoskeleton-for-Rehabilitation
This project focuses on the design and dynamic modeling of a hand exoskeleton assisted with hand pose estimation for rehabilitation of post-stroke patients. The work combines mechanical design, mathematical modeling, simulation into one integrated framework, to provide accurate movements while being lightweight and adaptable to different sizes.
